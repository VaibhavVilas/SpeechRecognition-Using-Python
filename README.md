Our Objective is to build a desktop based voice assistant (Sam) using Python’s pyttsx3 and speechRecognition library.

For the working we will be installing some required modules such as pyttsx3 it is a text-to-speech conversion library.
And as it goes for the voice of the assistant there are already 2 or more voices that come pre-installed in the system by the windows and we will be using any one of them using the sapi5 which is Microsoft speech api.
For getting the commands from user the ‘Speech Recognition’ is a library for performing speech recognition, with support for several engines and APIs, online and offline.

Sam can do basic tasks such as opening applications or websites such as google,youtube,VS Code etc.
Sam also tells us JOKES,plays games such as Guess the Number,gives info about the weather.
We can also LOG OUT,SHUTDOWN,RESTART from our PC using Sam.
